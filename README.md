h1. Bleep - a Spotify App

Bleep allows you to skip explicit songs by turning on a filter when using the desktop app.

For mobile, it's a little more complex. It creates copies of selected playlists without the songs marked explicit and will keep them in sync.

Unfortunately, Spotify decided to reject this app from their app store. If you disagree, or want to know why: See how [http://jacobsingh.name/content/spotify-rejects-my-app-millions-toddlers-get-their-mouths-washed-out-soap-0#comment-20126](Spotify's app store sucks).

If you want to use it, you need a developer key.  Follow instructions at https://developer.spotify.com/technologies/apps/.
